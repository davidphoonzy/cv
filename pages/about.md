# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

Learning about different systems of thought, methodologies, and structures is my hobby.

Understanding and testing how they interact and build upon each other in novel or unintended fashion is the source of my fascination.

My interests are in Politics, Philosophy and Economics, which I read up and pursue during my spare time, as a patron of various think-tanks.

How much social solidarity I've built, and public learning I've deepened, is how I would judge success.
